Implement proxy and web firewall functions with configured components
Apply web firewalls easily

- [NginxProxy 2.11.2](https://github.com/NginxProxyManager/nginx-proxy-manager)
- [Modsecurity 3.0.12](https://github.com/owasp-modsecurity/ModSecurity)
- [CRS 4.3.0](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset)


## Project Goal

Easily configure SSL certificates and web screens with high-performance proxy environments

## Features

- Beautiful and Secure Admin Interface based on [Tabler](https://tabler.github.io/)
- Easily create forwarding domains, redirections, streams and 404 hosts without knowing anything about Nginx
- Free SSL using Let's Encrypt or provide your own custom SSL certificates
- Access Lists and basic HTTP Authentication for your hosts
- Advanced Nginx configuration available for super users
- User management, permissions and audit log
- Setting the easiest web firewall policy

1. Install Docker and Docker-Compose

- [Docker Install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker-Compose Install documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. Create a docker-compose.yml file similar to this:

```yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    image: 'docker.io/jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest'
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '81:81'
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
```

This is the bare minimum configuration required. See the [documentation](https://nginxproxymanager.com/setup/) for more.

3. Bring up your stack by running

```bash
docker-compose up -d

# If using docker-compose-plugin
docker compose up -d

```

4. Log in to the Admin UI

When your docker container is running, connect to it on port `81` for the admin interface.
Sometimes this can take a little bit because of the entropy of keys.

[http://127.0.0.1:81](http://127.0.0.1:81)

Default Admin User:
```
Email:    admin@example.com
Password: changeme
```

Immediately after logging in with this default user you will be asked to modify your details and change your password.
